The data structures within this folder are the Python variants of common data structures. They use inheritance where possible to avoid duplication of similar code, where the parent classes are located within the parent folder. Each data structure has a core set of functionality including: removing an item, adding an item, checking the size of the structure, finding/peeking an item on the top or bottom of the structure, and analysing all the items within it.

The data structures within this folder are as follows:

Binary Search Tree,
